This past spring, I worked on a fascinating project for Jerry X. Mitrovica's EPS 261 course that combined cutting-edge sea level science with the historic city of Venice. Using state-of-the-art sea level fingerprinting techniques alongside topographical information, I assessed what Venice might face by 2100 under rising seas.

The project uses sea level fingerprinting techniques in combination with detailed topographical information on Venice to assess the risk posed by rising seas. The findings are sobering: we discovered that without intervention, by 2100 even a low-end sea level rise scenario will make what are currently decadal extremes an annual occurrence. Even more concerning, decadal extremes will match what we currently consider century-level disasters.

Venice's unique position makes it particularly vulnerable to sea level changes, and this analysis helped quantify just how dramatic those changes could be. The combination of global sea level rise patterns and local topography creates a perfect storm for this historic city.
