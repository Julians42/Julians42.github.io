A final project for *Applied Math 205: Numerical Methods*, this project was advised by Nick Derr and Chris Rycroft. Here, Chelsea Chen and I explore simulations of streamflow in a porous media with the twist of adding obstacles to see how the flow responds - we built a "castle" and watched streamflow erode around it!
