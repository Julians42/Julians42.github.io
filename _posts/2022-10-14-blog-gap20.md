I am taking Fall 2022 off from school to graduate on-cycle this spring. Current activities include thesis research, working to turn past projects into pesky publications (rewarding, but so much work!), exploring Vermont on foot, bike, and skis, and visiting friends. 

September Adventures
======
I made a video of some of my outdoor activities in September. Highlights include a wakeboarding concussion (not actually a highlight), a hiking trip to New Hampshire's White Mountains, and other adventures across Vermont.
