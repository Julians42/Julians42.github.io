Background
======
Since my sophomore year, I've trained and competed with the Harvard Varsity Nordic ski team (cross-country skiing). I walked onto the team after wanting a change from the clubs and club sports teams I participated in during my freshman year. Racing and training at the collegiate level have been incredibly rewarding and I've made some of my closest friends. My top finish to date is a 35th place finish in a mass start skate 20k. I am looking forward to one final 2023 race season!
