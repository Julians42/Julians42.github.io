These past few weeks I've been working towards submitting a proposal to the National Science Foundation to *potentially* help fund graduate studies. The NSF Graduate Research Fellowship Program funding is competitive to get but either way I felt like I learned a lot both about my own interests and goals and had a chance to reflect. In addition to the personal statement, I wrote a research proposal that combined my interests in drought, snow, and seismology. I've uploaded the proposal here as I had a lot of fun writing it and its a good example of the sorts of projects I am interested in.
