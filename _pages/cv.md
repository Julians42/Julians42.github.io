Experience
======
**Software Engineer, Coolant, Summer 2023**
 * Remote sensing and machine learning expert. Developed a pipeline to estimate carbon stock and land cover across Borneo using 10-meter Sentinel-1 and 2 data from google earth engine trained with convolutional neural networks

**Harvard Undergraduate Forestry Data Science Group, Summer 2022**
 * Applied small area estimators to address zero-inflated data for the U.S. Forest Service Inventory and Analysis division.
 * Developed an interactive [website](https://ncasi-shiny-tools.shinyapps.io/CPAT_Ver2_Demo/) for NCASI, an umbrella forestry service organization, to highlight the risks of climate change to national forests. 

**NOAA Hollings Scholar, Summer 2021**
 * Interned with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) on a joint project at Boulder Physical Sciences Lab and at Princeton's Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) investigating snow droughts using large ensemble climate models. 
 * Supervised by Mimi Hughes (PSL), Nathaniel Johnson (GFDL), and Kai-Chih Tseng (Taiwan University), the project is now [published](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039754)! 

**Harvard Seismology / U. Washington Seismology Groups, Feb 2020 - May 2021**
 * Built a Julia workflow for high-performance seismic data analysis on the AWS cloud to constrain an LA-area earthquake and deployed a workflow utilizing 100 times more data than a 2014 study. Presented at AGU, SCEC, and to the Stanford Seismology Group.
 * Used AWS EC2, S3, and Batch for parallel computing alongside containerization, bash scripting, and GitHub to extend the workflow to begin building a California-wide database of seismology cross-correlations with 100+ TBs of data.

Selected Awards
======
National Science Foundation Graduate Research Fellowship - *Spring 2023*
  * Five year fellowship with three years of financial support

NOAA Hollings Scholarship - *Spring 2020*
 * "The Hollings Scholarship Program provides successful undergraduate applicants with awards that include academic assistance (up to `$`9,500 per year) for two years of full-time study and a 10-week, full-time paid (`$`700/week) internship at an NOAA facility during the summer." - NOAA Hollings Program

Detur Book Prize - *Fall 2019*
 * "The Detur Book Prize is one of the oldest prizes at Harvard College. It recognizes sophomores who attained very high academic standing in their first year at the College and honors them with a book of their choice." - Harvard College Office of Undergraduate Education

Mathworks Math Modeling Finalist - *Spring 2017 & 2018*
 * My Middlebury Mathematics Team competed in both the 2017 and 2018 national Moody’s, and subsequently MathWorks, Math Modeling Challenges. In 2017, we earned a scholarship placing in the top five percent of teams while investigating the effects of climate change on the US’s five coastal National Parks. In 2018, the team investigated the issue of food waste, placing in the top 6 teams out of 913, each earning a $1000 college scholarship and the opportunity to present our findings on an all-expenses paid trip to Jane Street Financial in New York City.

College Clubs and Extracurriculars
=====
**Harvard Varsity Nordic Skiing, 2019-2023**
 * Walk-on member of the D1 Harvard Nordic Ski team. Represented skiing on the Student-Athlete Advisory Committee 2020-22.

**Applied Math Peer Concentration Advisor (PCA), 2021-22**
 * Coordinated the applied math advising team by facilitating 50 advisor/advisee pairings and 2-3 events per semester. 

<!-- * **Harvard Pops Orchestra, 2018-19 & 2022**
 * Played trumpet II for the Orchestra during my freshman year and junior spring.
