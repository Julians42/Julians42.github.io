Hi! I'm Julian, a first-year Ph.D. student in Envrionmental Science and Engineering at Caltech working with [Tapio Schneider](https://climate-dynamics.org/people/tapio-schneider/) as a member of the [Climate Modeling Alliance](https://clima.earth/) as well as [Andrew Thompson](https://web.gps.caltech.edu/~andrewt/). I'm broadly interested in applying mathematical tools to climate problems. At CliMA, this includes applying inverse methods to optimize climate model parameters in CliMA's atmosphere model, [ClimaAtmos.jl](https://github.com/CliMA/ClimaAtmos.jl), by developing more efficient loss functions. With Dr. Thompson, I am applying dimension reduction techniques to explore variability in ocean-ice interactions along the Antarctic margins.

Before Caltech, I completed my Bachelor's degree in Applied Mathematics at Harvard University in 2023 where I worked with [Marine Denolle](https://denolle-lab.github.io/) to develop a high-performance computing framework in the Julia Programming Language on Amazon Web Services, [Mimi Hughes](https://psl.noaa.gov/people/mimi.hughes/), [Nathaniel Johnson](https://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/nathaniel-johnson-homepage/), and [Kai-Chih Tseng](https://kuiper2000.github.io/) to track the future of snow droughts across the Western United States, and with [Kelly McConville](https://mcconville.rbind.io/) to design more robust estimators for studying U.S. forests. Post-grad, I worked briefly for [Coolant](https://coolant.earth/) as a software engineer developing machine learning tools for high-resolution carbon stock quantification.



<!-- This interest has taken me to the Icelandic continental divide, the snow-capped mountains of the Western United States, and the earthquake-prone regions of California via seismic data on cloud computing platforms. While not chasing snow, rocks, or earthquakes, I enjoy cross country skiing, trail running, and exploring new places. This site is intended to host a collection of my research experiences, talks, and other projects. -->
