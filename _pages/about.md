Personal Profile
====
Hi! I'm a senior at Harvard College studying Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Earth and Planetary Sciences. This niche arises because I'm passionate about applying mathematical and statistical tools to problems in the earth sciences. This interest has taken me to the Icelandic continental divide, the snow-capped mountains of the Western United States, and (virtually) to the earthquake-prone regions of California via seismic data on Amazon Web Services (AWS). While not chasing snow, rocks, or earthquakes, I enjoy playing trumpet and skiing with the Harvard Varsity Nordic Ski Team. I "made" this site to host a collection of projects for reference.
