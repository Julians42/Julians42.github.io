Personal Profile
====
Hi! I'm Julian, a senior at Harvard College studying Applied Mathematics, Statistics, and Earth and Planetary Sciences. I'm passionate about applying mathematical and statistical tools to problems in the earth sciences. This interest has taken me to the Icelandic continental divide, the snow-capped mountains of the Western United States, and (virtually) the earthquake-prone regions of California via seismic data on cloud computing platforms. While not chasing snow, rocks, or earthquakes, I enjoy playing trumpet and skiing with the Harvard Varsity Nordic Ski Team. This site is intended to host a collection of my research experiences, talks, and other projects.

Pictures of me doing fun things!
