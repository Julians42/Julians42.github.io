# UDFS x NCASI Climate Dashboard :evergreen_tree: :earth_americas:
This [repository](https://github.com/harvard-ufds/climate-dashboard) contains codes used in the deployment of the demo `R Shiny` app generated from the summer 2022 UDFS and NCASI stakeholder collaboration. The project leveraged large ensemble climate data alongside 1/8Â° resolution tree species information. We were tasked both with incorporating uncertainty into the *Climate Prediction and Analysis Tool* (CPAT) and update the user experience. We presented these results at the annual NCASI climate webinar live to over 200 people. 

## Where can I find the app? :computer:
Feel free to checkout the working demo [here](https://ncasi-shiny-tools.shinyapps.io/CPAT_Ver2_Demo/)! NCASI hopes to deploy a similar product for the entire US eventually as a member-only service.

## Who is NCASI? :deciduous_tree:
The National Council for Air and Stream Improvement, Inc, or [NCASI](https://www.ncasi.org), has the goal of help members cost-effectively meet their environmental and sustainability goals through basic and applied research, technical support, and education. This project supports their goal of applied research alongside education and educational outreach. Feel free to check them out! 

## Project Thanks :bangbang:
We are greatful to Dr. Kelly McConville, Dr. Kate Hu, Dr. Holly Munro, amd Dr. Stephen Prisley for their inspiration and help!
