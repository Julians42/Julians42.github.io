A collaboration with Mimi Hughes (NOAA PSL), Kai-Chih Tseng (Taiwan University), and Nathaniel Johnson (NOAA GFDL) investigating changes in snow drought projections over the 20th and 21st centuries. Accepted to the *Journal of Geophysical Research: Atmospheres* on May 25, 2024. Access [here](https://doi.org/10.1029/2023JD039754).

<!-- I started this paper during my internship with NOAA during the summer of 2021. The results have motivated continued research to investigate and report on the future of snow droughts in the Western US using large ensemble data. We specifically focus on developing measures of uncertainty around snow drought frequency and a metric called "no-snow transition time" to assess how quickly conditions will degrade. We are making a few final edits before submitting to internal review and are targetting *JGR: Atmospheres* for a journal submission. The project is funded through the NOAA Hollings Scholarship Program, with connections to the Boulder NCAR Lab and Princeton's GFDL Lab. The project is mentored by Mimi Hughes (NOAA PSL), Kai-Chih Tseng (Taiwan University, formerly Princeton), and Nathaniel Johnson (NOAA GFDL).
