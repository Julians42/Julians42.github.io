Ongoing work to investigate the future of snow droughts in the Western US using large ensemble data. We specifically focus on developing measures of uncertainty around snow drought frequency and a metric called the no-snow transition. This project came out of an internship funded through the NOAA Hollings Scholarship Program where I worked at the Boulder NCAR Lab and Princeton's GFDL Lab. The project is mentored by Mimi Hughes (NOAA PSL), Kai-Chih Tseng (Taiwan University, formerly Princeton), and Nathaniel Johnson (NOAA GFDL).
