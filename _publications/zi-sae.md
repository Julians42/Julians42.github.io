A collaboration during summer 2022 at the Harvard Forestry Data Science Lab under Kelly McConville. The study has been submitted to the Canadian Journal of Forest Research.


<!-- Worked with US Forest Inventory and Analysis (FIA) data to build and evaluate an estimator, called the zero-inflation small area estimation (ZI-SAE) estimator. I worked in collaboration with Reed College student Josh Yamamoto under the direction of Kelly McConville and used `R` and the Harvard RC cluster to run the simulations. Feel free to take a look at a draft version of the paper we're eventually hoping to submit: [Download draft here.](http://julians42.github.io/files/ZI_SAE.pdf) (updated Oct 29, 2022). -->
