A final project for *Applied Math 205: Numerical Methods*, this paper was advised by Nick Derr and Chris Rycroft. Here, Chelsea Chen and I explore simulations of streamflow in a porous media with the twist of adding obstacles to see how the flow responds - we built a "castle" and watched streamflow erode around it! Feel free to check out our implementation in Python [here](https://github.com/Julians42/AM205_Final_Project) or [Download our paper here](http://julians42.github.io/files/Schmitt_Chen_AM205_Final_Project.pdf).
