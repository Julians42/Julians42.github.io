Co-presented a tutorial on using commercial cloud computing services for seismology applications with PI Marine Denolle and Tim Clements to the Stanford Seismology Group led by Professor Beroza. I provided a technical workflow example using the Julia programming language on AWS with step-by-step instructions for getting started with AWS: from selecting instance configurations and getting key pairs set up to create an Amazon machine image built with Julia packages.
