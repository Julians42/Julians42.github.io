Co-presented a tutorial on using commerical cloud computing services for seismology applications with PI Marine Denolle and Tim Clements to the Stanford Seismology Group. I provided a technical workflow example using the Julia programming language on AWS with step-by-step instructions for getting started with AWS: from selecting instance configurations and getting key pairs set up to creating an Amazon machine image built with Julia packages. I made an accompanying tutorial video which has over 150 unique views to date. I'm copying it below:
